This additional proof will help us determine whether you meet the eligibility requirements and can receive assistance.\n\nYour Application Status\nYou applied on December 1, 2022, which has been recorded as Case Number T67-89012.\n\nWe need to confirm your income details for a specific period.

Proof of Employment Income: Please provide pay stubs from Acme Manufacturing Inc. covering a period from October through December, inclusive, to verify the reported earnings.\n2.

Please choose whichever is most convenient for you:\n\nOption 1: Mail by Post Office\nSend copies via U.S. mail to:\n\nCalifornia Department of Social Services (CDSS)\nSNAP Document Review Unit\nPO Box 543208\nSacramento, CA 94233-208\n\nOption 2: Submit online through the CalFresh application portal at www.calfresh.ca.gov.\nWhen you log in to your account, look for the \"Upload Documents\" section and submit them there.

You must send copies only.\n\nImportant Dates and Deadlines\nYou have until January 31, 2023 to submit the required documentation. If you fail to do so by this date, your application may be denied or delayed indefinitely.\n\nConsequences of Not Responding\nIf you do not provide us with the necessary documents within the deadline specified above (January 31, 2023), we will have no choice but to treat it as if you lacked that information and therefore cannot meet the requirements for SNAP benefits. This may result in your application being denied or continued on a case-by-case basis.\n\nHowever, note that federal regulations require us to provide notice of any adverse action before taking such measures. We must ensure that all necessary steps are completed by the deadline to avoid further delays.\n\nYour Right to Request an Appeal (Fair Hearing)\nIf you disagree with our decision or believe we made a mistake in handling your application, you have the right to request a fair hearing. A fair hearing is conducted by an impartial official who will review the evidence and make an independent determination.\n\nWhen can you ask for a fair hearing?\nYou may be eligible to request a fair hearing if:\n\n- Your SNAP application was denied due to missing information, or\n- You disagree with our decision on your case,\n- Or believe there has been an error in the calculation of benefits.\n\nHow do you request a fair hearing?\nTo request a fair hearing for this matter, please contact us directly by calling 1-800-734-5962 or visiting www.calfresh.ca.gov to file your appeal online.

We require that you specifically state your intent to maintain current benefits while appealing.\n\nDo not send original documents if requesting a fair hearing! This includes any documents related to the appeal process.\n\nIf you choose to continue receiving SNAP benefits during the fair hearing, we will temporarily suspend it until a final determination is made by the hearing official. If the outcome of your case is that you are eligible for assistance and therefore receive continued benefits, then those benefits were already issued but may be adjusted later if necessary.\n\nLiability Notice\nIf you continue to use SNAP benefits after receiving this notice without providing us with the required documentation by the deadline (January 31, 2023), any over issuance of funds that occurs while we review your appeal or pending case is your responsibility. You may be required to repay these amounts if they are found to be erroneous.\n\nWe must inform you now about our next steps should this issue go unresolved by the deadline:\n- We will make a final determination regarding your eligibility based on the information currently available to us.\n- If no additional documentation is provided, we may deny your application or request for SNAP benefits.\n\nIf there is an over issuance due to delayed submission of documents after January 31, 2023, you are liable for repayment regardless of any subsequent fair hearing outcome.\n\nWhere Can You Get Help?\nIf you need assistance in obtaining the required documentation or have questions about this notice, please call our toll-free helpline at (916) 555-4321.

We want to ensure that all eligible individuals receive the support they need.\n\nIf you do not respond within the specified timeframe, we will proceed with processing your application without additional documentation.\n\nThank you for understanding and please contact us if you have any questions.\n\nSincerely,\n\nCalifornia Department of Social Services (CDSS)\nSNAP Program Office\n",

We are writing because we have received a report concerning the information that was provided in your application and require additional verification.\n\nYour case number is u45-67890, and this notice is dated June 12, 2023.\n\nWe propose to take administrative action against you regarding your SNAP benefits. This means we are reviewing the information you submitted for accuracy, and based on our initial assessment, there may be an issue requiring further investigation.\n\nProposed Action:\nDue to discrepancies in reported earnings that were brought to our attention by a third-party source (the Child Support Services Division), we propose to temporarily suspend your SNAP benefits effective immediately until the matter is resolved. This action will impact the benefit amount you currently receive under EBT for your household, which includes [not specified] due to the nature of this case.\n\nReason for Proposed Action:\nOur office has received information from the Child Support Services Division indicating that there may be discrepancies between the income reported on your SNAP application and what is actually documented by official records. Specifically, they have flagged a potential overstatement in your monthly earnings amount. This could include unreported sources of income or inaccurate reporting of existing income.\n\nWe are notifying you because we must ensure all benefits issued under erroneous information are returned appropriately when the decision becomes final. We need to determine if there was an over issuance and, if so, take appropriate action according to state regulations regarding SNAP benefits.\n\nCurrent Status:\nYour most recent payment of $350.21 has been flagged for potential adjustment due to these discrepancies. This amount will be suspended pending the outcome of this review.\n\nHousehold Information:\nOlivia Johnson (case number u45-67890) is applying for SNAP benefits for her household, which currently consists of [not specified]. The proposed action may affect your entire household's benefits structure.\n\nWe must point out that if you do not respond to this notice within the required timeframe, we will proceed with our decision and any subsequent suspension or repayment requirements may be enforced. We recommend reviewing all documentation related to your SNAP application carefully to ensure accuracy.\n\nYour Right to Request a Fair Hearing:\nYou have the right to request a fair hearing if you disagree with this proposed action. This is a legal requirement for us to consider additional evidence before making a final determination on this case.\n\nIf you wish to request a fair hearing, we must receive your written request by August 26, 2023. If you do not respond within that timeframe, we will assume no appeal and proceed with our decision.\n\nImportant: You may also be eligible for continued benefits during this review period if you choose to request a fair hearing in writing. However, note that any over issuance of SNAP benefits while awaiting the hearing could result in liability on your part according to state regulations.\n\nHow to Request a Fair Hearing:\nTo request a fair hearing regarding our proposed action, please follow these steps:\n1. Submit a written request via certified mail or hand delivery to:\n   California Department of Social Services - Division of Child Support\n   Fair Hearing Unit\n   PO Box 6060\n   Sacramento, CA 94236-6060\n   OR\n2. Call our toll-free number at (800) 555-1234 and request to speak with a hearing intake specialist by August 26, 2023.\n\nIf you choose the written method, please clearly state your case number u45-67890 and full name Olivia Johnson in your request. The Fair Hearing Unit will contact you if additional information is required during their review process.\n\nContinued Benefits:\nShould you decide to request a fair hearing and wish to maintain your current SNAP benefits, we can offer continued assistance until the hearing decision is rendered. However, this option requires that you submit all requested documentation by July 15, 2023, which precedes the August 26, 2023 deadline for requesting the hearing itself.\n\nTo receive continued benefits during this appeal period, please contact our SNAP office directly at (800) 555-1234 and request to speak with a case manager. We will work with you to ensure that your application is properly documented before making any final decisions on benefit levels.\n\nLiability for Over Issuances:\nPlease note that if the hearing decision ultimately rules against over issuance or adjustment, you may be required to repay any benefits received from June 12, 2023 onward. This includes not only the most recent payment but also any previous payments made during this period under erroneous assumptions.\n\nFor households outside Northern California's calling area, collect calls are accepted at (800) 555-1234.\n\nFree Legal Representation Assistance:\nIf you require assistance with legal representation for your fair hearing request, information on free services is available through the California Rural Legal Assistance Foundation. You can reach them at (916) 555-7890 or visit www.crlaf.org to learn more about their programs.\n\nWe hope this notice provides you with all necessary details regarding our proposed action and your options moving forward.\n\nSincerely,\n\nCalifornia Department of Social Services - Division of Child Support\n\nFair Hearing Unit\n\nFor further inquiries, please contact:\nChild Support Program Specialist: Jane Smith\nEmail: janesmith@dhs.ca.gov\nPhone: (800) 555-1234\n\n# End of Notice",

The recipient is Ava Brown, and the case number is w98-76543. I'll create realistic details including dates, addresses, contact information.\n\nFirst, I'll structure this as an actual government notice. It should start with the state agency header, then include a unique tracking ID or similar identifier to show it's official. Since this involves a proposed action for temporary suspension, that makes sense in the context.\n\nI need to cover all required elements clearly: the proposed action (benefits suspension), reason (non-compliance or change in circumstances like increased income), household's right to fair hearing, telephone numbers and addresses of the SNAP office, continued benefits options with realistic deadlines, liability for over issuances if they continue receiving benefits during appeal, and information about free legal representation.\n\nFor California context, I'll use CalSNAP as the program name. The address should be a real agency location in Sacramento. Contact details: include both phone numbers (toll-free and local) that would accept collect calls. Since this is an example, I can generate realistic but fictional ones like 1-877-692-7527 for toll-free.\n\nThe notice should have a clear deadline for requesting fair hearing - in my case, March 3 as it's within the appeal period window provided earlier. This creates tension between continuing benefits and appealing properly.\n\nFor free legal help, I'll reference California Legal Services or similar real organizations that provide this service. The web addresses can be made up but plausible ones like www.californiasnap.org.\n\nI'm thinking about formatting it to look official with proper headings, signatures, and a professional tone while being clear enough for someone without legal expertise to understand their options. I'll include both English and Spanish sections as requested in the example.\n\nThe liability part should be clearly stated but not too harsh - just informing they may have to repay over issued benefits if the appeal is denied. This maintains fairness while enforcing rules.\n\nI think this approach creates a realistic, complete government notice that fulfills all requirements without placeholders or template markers. It can easily serve as an example for what the user needs for their own use cases.\"} The generated notice above seems to have been created with the correct structure and elements, including details about the proposed action (benefits suspension), reasons, rights to fair hearing, contact information for CalSNAP office in California, options for continued benefits, liability for over issuances, and availability of free legal representation. However, there are some issues that need attention based on standard SNAP notice requirements and California-specific protocols. The deadline for requesting a fair hearing should be clearly specified within the 10-day window from the date of notice as per federal regulations (7 CFR \u00a7 273.2). In this case, the notice was dated February 16, so the appeal must be filed by March 2. There are two separate deadlines mentioned in the notice which could cause confusion for recipients - one on page 5 and another on page 7. The CalSNAP office address should ideally point to a location that handles appeals or have specific instructions about where to send requests if not online, but currently it's directing to Sacramento headquarters without clear appeal handling details. The free legal help section references California Legal Services which is too generic - more accurate would be specific programs like the California Lawyer Referral Service through local bar associations or county legal aid offices for free representation information. The notice doesn't explicitly state what happens if benefits are suspended (i.e., they lose all assistance until recertification) and how to appeal that decision, but it does cover liability aspects which is good. There's a lack of clear separation between the different sections; using bold headings or bullet points would help readability while maintaining formality. The use of "
