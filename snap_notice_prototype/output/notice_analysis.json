          "answer": "No",
          "reason": "The notice states that the County of Santa Clara has approved cash aid for Mallard Ducksman, but it does not specify if this is an increase or a new approval. It mentions the change from $237 to $241 due to including Jeffrey Fiddlebrush, implying an increase, but the action taken isn't explicitly described as anything specific like termination or denial."

          "answer": "Yes",
          "reason": "The notice explains that the change is due to a state law update effective January 1, 2017. It details that children in certain situations (those who received four consecutive months of CalWORKs aid right before birth) are now eligible for cash aid under this new legal basis."

          "answer": "Yes",

It doesn't provide contact information, explain liability for overpayments, mention free legal services or continued benefits clearly."

          "reason": "This notice fails on multiple counts: lack of right to fair hearing, no contact information (both phone and person), missing liability for overpayments, absence of legal advocacy mention. While it uses plain language effectively in some parts, these omissions mean it does not meet SNAP best practices."
