There is a contradiction regarding whether the notice includes liability for over-issuances, as the retrieval context does not mention it at all. Another point concerns the inclusion of contact details; while the claim says no specific telephone number or contact person is mentioned, the retrieval context only states that a method to request a state hearing is provided on the back without confirming if such details are included."

First, some 'No' answers were provided with detailed explanations that contradict the prompt's instruction for a simple 'No'. Second, no 'IDK' responses were given when information was unclear or ambiguous according to the second requirement. Third, although a summary question exists at the end, it is answered as 'No' without explicitly summarizing all previous questions."

Another contradiction is that the claim states the notice fails on several counts including lack of right to fair hearing, etc., but these are not mentioned in the retrieval context at all. However, note that the example says to provide correction ONLY when verdict is 'no', and here it's 'yes' so no direct contradiction was provided for those points."

Second, the claim states that one can request a state hearing for any mistake or problems other than new law, whereas the retrieval context indicates hearings are available only for mistakes in amount or problems unrelated to the new law.
