        "reason": "The prompt alignment score is 0.00 because the LLM actual output completely fails to follow several critical instructions from the input. First, it does not include a request for proof as required by one of the unalignment reasons (the notice doesn't ask the recipient to provide any evidence or documentation). Second, it does not explicitly state the reason for requesting proof; instead, it vaguely references 'insufficient information' without providing context on what specific information is needed. Third, while mentioning continued benefits until February 28th, it fails to clearly explain how this option relates to the proposed suspension and under what conditions it might be revoked (the prompt requires a clear explanation of availability). Fourth, despite having multiple sections about fair hearings, the notice does not adequately address the liability aspect for over issuances in relation to continued benefits - specifically failing to mention that if they continue receiving benefits during appeal, they may lose them entirely upon adverse decision. Fifth, it uses overly complex legal jargon throughout (e.g., 'erroneous assumption', detailed hearing process descriptions) which contradicts the prompt's instruction to use simple language for an average recipient."
