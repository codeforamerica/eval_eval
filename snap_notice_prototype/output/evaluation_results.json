Additionally, while some answers are correct and in the right format (like 'Yes' for specific actions), the inconsistent use of 'IDK' when other questions could have been answered with clarity indicates that the overall instruction to provide consistent responses was not followed."

Specifically, it includes references to telephone numbers and contact persons not mentioned in the context, statements about liability during appeals or adverse decisions without corresponding details in the context, and assertions regarding free legal representation services or advocacy options that are absent from the context. Additionally, there is a claim that the notice uses simple language for a 6th grade reading level, but this is also not directly supported by the retrieval context."

Additionally, the claim states that liability for over issuances is not included in the notice, but this isn't addressed by the retrieval context which only describes what's present without mentioning absence of such details. The claim also asserts that no telephone number or specific contact person is provided, yet the retrieval context doesn't confirm their absence and might imply they are there if it were to mention them."

The score is low due to these failures to properly align with the prompt instructions."
