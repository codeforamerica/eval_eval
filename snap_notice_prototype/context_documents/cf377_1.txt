State Hearing: If you think this action is wrong, you can ask for a hearing. The back of this page tells you how.
Your benefits may not be changed if you ask for a hearing before this action takes place.
Rules: These rules apply:

You may review them at your welfare office.
CF 377.1 (9/15) REQUIRED FORM-SUBSTITUTE PERMITTED
 

YOUR APPLICATION FOR CALFRESH BENEFITS HAS BEEN APPROVED.

Your initial amount of benefits is: $81 for October, 2024. Your benefit amount for the rest of your certification period will be $231 from 2024-11-01 through 2025-04-01.

IF YOU ALSO APPLIED FOR CASH AID, and it has not yet been approved, your CalFresh benefits may be lowered or stopped without another notice if your cash aid is approved.
 
Your CalFresh eligibility starts the same day as your cash aid.
 
Your first month's benefits include more than one month's benefits because of the date your application was approved.
 
Your first month's benefits were prorated from the date you filed your application.
 
BECAUSE YOU RECEIVED CALFRESH BENEFITS RIGHT AWAY, we did not require you to give us the following verification:

You must give us this verification before 2025-04-01 or your CalFresh eligibility will stop. You will not get another notice. If the verification you send changes your eligibility or benefits, we will make the change. You will not get an advance notice before we take this action.

Your CalFresh household may be eligible to a State Utility Assistance Subsidy (SUAS) payment. If eligible, the county will award you a $20.01 SUAS cash payment. This is a one-time per year payment and if eligible it will be put into your cash EBT account. If you do not have a cash EBT account, one will be set up for you on your CalFresh EBT card. You will not have to do anything to get a new card, but you can use it to cover expenses not otherwise covered by CalFresh. This payment allows the county to use the highest utility deduction (Standard Utility Allowance - SUA) for food benefits. You may use this $20.01 when you use your EBT card. If you want to know more, please contact your local county office.

If you ask for a hearing before an action on Cash Aid, Medi-Cal, CalFresh (Food Stamps), or Child Care takes place:

 - Your Cash Aid or Medi-Cal will stay the same while you wait for a hearing.
 - Your Child Care Services may stay the same while you wait for a hearing.
 - Your CalFresh (Food Stamps) will stay the same until the hearing or the end of your certification period, whichever is earlier.

If the hearing decision says we are right, you will owe us for any extra Cash Aid, CalFresh (Food Stamps) or Child Care Services you got. To let us lower or stop your benefits before the hearing, check below:

- [ ] Cash Aid
- [ ] CalFresh (Food Stamps)
- [ ] Child Care

While You Wait for a Hearing Decision for:

Welfare to Work:

You do not have to take part in the activities. You may receive child care payments for employment and for activities approved by the county before this notice. If we told you your other supportive services payments will stop, you will not get any more payments, even if you go to your activity. If we told you we will pay your other supportive services, they will be paid in the amount and in the way we told you in this notice.

 - To get those supportive services, you must go to the activity the county told you to attend.
 - If the amount of supportive services the county pays while you wait for a hearing decision is not enough to allow you to participate, you can stop going to the activity.

Cal-Learn:

 - You cannot participate in the Cal-Learn Program if we told you we cannot serve you.
 - We will only pay for Cal-Learn supportive services for an approved activity.

OTHER INFORMATION

Medi-Cal Managed Care Plan Members: The action on this notice may stop you from getting services from your managed care health plan. You may wish to contact your health plan membership services if you have questions.
Child and/or Medical Support: The local child support agency will help collect support at no cost even if you are not on cash aid. If they now collect support for you, they will keep doing so unless you tell them in writing to stop. They will send you current support money collected but will keep past due money collected that is owed to the county.

Family Planning:

Your welfare office will give you information when you ask for it.

Hearing File:
If you ask for a hearing, the State Hearing Division will set up a file. You have the right to see this file before your hearing and to get a copy of the county's written position on your case at least two days before the hearing. The state may give your hearing file to the Welfare Department and the U.S. Departments of Health and Human Services and Agriculture. (W&I Code Sections 10850 and 10950.)
