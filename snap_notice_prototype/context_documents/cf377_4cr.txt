- [X] CHANGE IN BENEFITS

Effective 2024-12-01, your CalFresh benefits are changed from $237 to $281 each month because:

The people in your assistance unit (AU) has changed from 3 to 4.

You have already been told about an overissuance of CalFresh benefits and you are getting less CalFresh benefits because the County has been reducing your monthly allotment by 10% or $10 (whichever is more) to pay back the CalFresh benefits that you got and should not have. It has been decided in court or by a state hearing or because you signed a Disqualification Consent Agreement or an Administrative Disqualification Hearing Waiver that this overissuance is an Intentional Program Violation (IPV). Now your monthly allotment is being changed because the County can begin reducing your allotment by 20% or $10 (whichever is more). If there are any other changes to your monthly CalFresh allotment, this form will tell you.

YOUR HEARING RIGHTS

You have the right to ask for a hearing if you disagree with any county action. You have only 90 days to ask for a hearing. The 90 days started the day after the county gave or mailed you this notice. If you have good cause as to why you were not able to file for a hearing within the 90 days, you may still file for a hearing. If you provide good cause, a hearing may still be scheduled.

If you ask for a hearing before an action on Cash Aid, Medi-Cal, CalFresh, or Child Care takes place:

- Your Cash Aid or Medi-Cal will stay the same while you wait for a hearing.
- Your Child Care Services may stay the same while you wait for a hearing.
- Your CalFresh benefits will stay the same until the hearing or the end of your certification period, whichever is earlier.

If the hearing decision says we are right, you will owe us for any extra Cash Aid, CalFresh or Child Care Services you got. To let us lower or stop your benefits before the hearing, check below:

Yes, lower or stop:

- [ ] Cash Aid
- [ ] CalFresh
- [ ] Child Care

While You Wait for a Hearing Decision for:

Welfare to Work:

You do not have to take part in the activities.

You may receive child care payments for employment and for activities approved by the county before this notice.

If we told you your other supportive services payments will stop, you will not get any more payments, even if you go to your activity.

If we told you we will pay your other supportive services, they will be paid in the amount and in the way we told you in this notice.

- To get those supportive services, you must go to the activity the county told you to attend.
- If the amount of supportive services the county pays while you wait for a hearing decision is not enough to allow you to participate, you can stop going to the activity.

Cal-Learn:
- You cannot participate in the Cal-Learn Program if we told you we cannot serve you.
- We will only pay for Cal-Learn supportive services for an approved activity.

OTHER INFORMATION
