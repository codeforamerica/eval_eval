Your family's needs and income are figured on this page.

When you get paid every week or every other week, here is how we figure your monthly income:

• If you get paid every week, you may get paid 4 or 5 times in a month. 4.33 is the average number of payments in a month.

• If you get paid every other week, you may get paid 2 or 3 times in a month. 2.167 is the average number of payments in a month.
