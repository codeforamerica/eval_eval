## If you ask for a hearing before an action on Cash Aid, Medi-Cal, CalFresh (Food Stamps), or Child Care takes place:

• Your Cash Aid or Medi-Cal will stay the same while you wait for a hearing.
• Your Child Care Services may stay the same while you wait for a hearing.
• Your CalFresh (Food Stamps) will stay the same until the hearing or the end of your certification period, whichever is earlier.

If the hearing decision says we are right, you will owe us for any extra Cash Aid, CalFresh (Food Stamps) or Child Care Services you got. To let us lower or stop your benefits before the hearing, check below:

**Yes, lower or stop:**
■■ Cash Aid ■■ CalFresh (Food Stamps)

## While You Wait for a Hearing Decision for:

**Welfare to Work:**
You do not have to take part in the activities.
You may receive child care payments for employment and for activities approved by the county before this notice.

If we told you your other supportive services payments will stop, you will not get any more payments, even if you go to your activity.

If we told you we will pay your other supportive services, they will be paid in the amount and in the way we told you in this notice.

• To get those supportive services, you must go to the activity the county told you to attend.
• If the amount of supportive services the county pays while you wait for a hearing decision is not enough to allow you to participate, you can stop going to the activity.

## OTHER INFORMATION

**Medi-Cal Managed Care Plan Members:** The action on this notice may stop you from getting services from your managed care health plan. You may wish to contact your health plan membership services if you have questions.

**Child and/or Medical Support:** The local child support agency will help collect support at no cost even if you are not on cash aid. If they now collect support for you, they will keep doing so unless you tell them in writing to stop. They will send you current support money collected but will keep past due money collected that is owed to the county.
