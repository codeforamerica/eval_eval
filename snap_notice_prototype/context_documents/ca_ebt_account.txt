YOUR HEARING RIGHTS
You have the right to ask for a hearing if you disagree with
any county action. You have only 90 days to ask for a
hearing. The 90 days started the day after the county gave or
mailed you this notice. If you have good cause as to why
you were not able to file for a hearing within the 90 days, you
may still file for a hearing. If you provide good cause, a
hearing may still be scheduled.
If you ask for a hearing before an action on Cash Aid,
Medi-Cal, CalFresh, or Child Care takes place:
- Your Cash Aid or Medi-Cal will stay the same while you wait for a
hearing.
- Your Child Care Services may stay the same while you wait for a
hearing.
- Your CalFresh benefits will stay the same until the hearing or the
end of your certification period, whichever is earlier.
If the hearing decision says we are right, you will owe us for any
extra Cash Aid, CalFresh or Child Care Services you got. To let
us lower or stop your benefits before the hearing, check below:

paid in the amount and in the way we told you in this notice.

we cannot serve you.

approved activity.
