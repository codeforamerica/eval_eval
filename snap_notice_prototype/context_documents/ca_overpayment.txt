State of California

Department of Social Services

You got too much cash aid. You were

overpaid $______ on (date).

HERE IS WHY:

The overpayment was

[ ] The county's fault. The EBT

company repaid you the stolen

benefits after the county had

already sent you replacement

benefits.

[ ] Your mistake. The county

determined your EBT benefits were

not electronically stolen.

[ ] Your fault. You filed a false

report. We may charge you with a

crime or you may be disqualified

from aid for an intentional program

violation.

( ) Your fault. You filed an additional

Scammed benefit reimbursement within 36 months

Of your original request.

WARNING: If you think this

overpayment is wrong, ask for a

hearing. The back of this page

tells how. If you stay on aid, the

County can collect an overpayment by

lowering your monthly grant. If you

go off aid before the overpayment is

paid back, the County may take what

you owe out of your state income tax

refund or take other legal action to

collect.
