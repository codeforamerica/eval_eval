On 2024-12-17, the county completed your eligibility redetermination and approved your cash aid for the next semi-annual or annual reporting period. You completed the annual redetermination for your assistance unit and told the county facts about your case.  The county looked at these facts and figured that your cash aid will not change at this time.

You must remember to report mandatory changes that happen before your next report within 10 days after they happen.

- Anytime someone moves into or out of your household
- Anytime someone joins, or is in your household, who is in violation of a condition of probation or parole
- Anytime someone joins, or is in your household, who is running from the law.
- Anytime you have an address change
- When your total income is over the Income Reporting Threshold (IRT)

You can report changes by calling the county or by using the SAR 3 mid-period report form.  Ask the County if you have questions about what you must report mid-period.

Your cash aid amount is figured on this notice.
