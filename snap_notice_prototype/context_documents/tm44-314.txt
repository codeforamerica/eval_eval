Effective January 1, 2017, the County of Santa Clara has approved cash aid for Mallard Ducksman.

Your cash aid has changed from $237 to $241 because your cash aid payment now includes Jeffrey Fiddlebrush.

Hereâ€™s why:

State Law has changed. Effective January 1, 2017, children who were not eligible for CalWORKs cash aid because of the Maximum Family Grant(MFG)rule are now eligible. Under the MFG rule, aid did not go up for a child born into a family that got written notice of the rule  and then got cash aid for ten months in a row right before his/her birth.  

If you think there is a mistake in the amount of your cash aid, or if you have problems other than with the new law you can ask for a state hearing. The back of this notice tells you how.

Your new cash aid amount is figured on this notice.
