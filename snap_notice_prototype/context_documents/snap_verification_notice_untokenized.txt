Your Right to a Fair Hearing

What is a fair hearing?

If you disagree with a decision made on your SNAP application or case, you have the right to request a fair hearing. A fair hearing means that an official will review the facts of your case in a fair and objective manner as required by law.

In what situations can you ask for a fair hearing?

You may ask for a fair hearing if any of the following apply to you:

- You applied for SNAP benefits and were denied.

- You disagree with a decision on your case.

- You believe your SNAP benefits were not calculated correctly.

When is the deadline to request a fair hearing?

- If you want a fair hearing because we closed your SNAP case or denied your request for SNAP benefits, you must request it by December 20, 2020.

- If you want a fair hearing about your current SNAP benefits, you may request a fair hearing any time before December 20, 2020.

- If you request a hearing because we closed your case or decreased your SNAP benefits, you may choose to keep getting your benefits until a hearing decision is made. You may choose to continue receiving SNAP benefits only if your certification period has not ended. If you choose to do this, you may have to pay those SNAP benefits back if you lose the fair hearing. To continue your SNAP benefits, you must request a fair hearing by December 21, 2020.

How do you ask for a fair hearing?

To request a fair hearing:

1. [State can fill in specific procedures for requesting a fair hearing in-person, in writing, and over the phone in a numbered list]

2.
